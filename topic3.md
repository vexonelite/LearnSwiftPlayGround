It’s time to put everything you’ve learned together to create your own types.
You can create your own type by combining variables and functions into a new type definition. 
For example, integers and doubles might not be enough for your purposes, 
so you might need to create a type to store complex numbers. 
Or maybe storing first, middle and last names in three independent variables is getting difficult to manage, so you decide to create a FullName type.

When you create a new type, you get to give it a name; 
thus, these custom types are known as named types. 
Structures are a powerful for modeling the real world concepts. 
You can encapsulate related concepts, properties and methods into a single, cohesive model.

• Chapter 12, Properties
• Chapter 13, Methods


Swift, in fact, includes four kinds of named types: structures, classes, enumerations and protocols. 
Now that you understand structures work with methods and properties 
you can see how the other named types use these same concepts, how they differ, and where you want to use each.

• Chapter 16, Enumerations

Finally, you expand your knowledge of the type system by learning about generics:
types and methods that take as input other types instead of just methods. 
Swift’s key to safety, speed and expressiveness lies in the ability to utilize generic types.

Custom types make it possible to build large and complex things with the basic building blocks you’ve learned so far. 
It’s time to take your Swift apprenticeship to the next level!
