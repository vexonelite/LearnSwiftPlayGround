// Chapter 10: Collection Iteration with Closures

// The previous section taught you about "functions". But Swift has another object you can use to "break up code into reusable chunks: a closure". They become particularly useful when dealing with collections.

// A closure is simply "a function with no name"; you can assign it to a variable and pass it around like any other value. This chapter shows you how convenient and useful closures can be.
